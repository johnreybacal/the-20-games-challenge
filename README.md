# [The 20 games challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/)

Learning game development with Godot with the 20 games challenge instead of plunging into tutorial hell

I will do all games and log what I learned in a README file for each game

## Games
 - [01: Pong](01/pong/README.md)
 - 01: Flappy Bird
 - 02: Breakout
 - 02: Jetpack Joyride
 - 03: Space Invaders
 - 03: Frogger
 - 03: River Raid
 - ...

 
## Development Constraints
 - Google search as primary source of information (as it was)
 - Disable copilot's next edit suggestion
 - Only use AI to ask about mathematics/physics stuff used in game dev


## TODO
 - Create menu to access all games
   - 01 Pong: vs CPU / vs Human option
 - Deploy to itch.io
